# Delivery Dash
Simple 2d race game. The Player collects objects and delivers them to points.
My goals are: 
1. SOLID & Clean code structure
2. Add opponents (competitors) that will compete with player (A*-based)
3. Complete project :D 

So, I've complete the project. All works fine for now. Next steps are refactor some code, because there are a few things that can be better, especially dependencies in the code. I tried to keep clean structure but for now it's a bit hard, because I don't understand where all fine and where I need to refactor code parts
